### Day 37 Priorities

#### 1. Selective High-Performance Ensemble
```python
# Only include models with >55% accuracy
high_performers = {
    name: model for name, model in trained_models.items()
    if validation_accuracy[name] > 0.55
}
```

#### 2. Advanced Meta-Learning
```python
# More sophisticated meta-models
meta_models = {
    'XGBoost': XGBRegressor(n_estimators=30),
    'Neural': MLPRegressor(hidden_layer_sizes=(15,)),
    'Voting': VotingRegressor(estimators=high_performers)
}
```

#### 3. Boosting Integration
